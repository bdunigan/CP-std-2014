		<p><b style="color:#ff8080;">Red:</b> The red line is the cutline. It is very important that your photo extends past this line on all four edges.</p>

		<p><b style="color:#81c0ff;">Blue:</b> The blue line is the outside edge of your print file. For the best results, please make sure your photo touches the blue line on all four edges.</p>

		<p>The parts of your photo that fall between the red and blue lines become your bleed area and will be cut off. For an idea of what the trimmed pieces will look like, simply turn off the guides.</p>
